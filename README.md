# DocPad Sitemap Plugin

This DocPad plugin will automatically generate a valid `sitemap.xml` file for search engines. It's merely a wrapper for the [sitemap.js](https://github.com/ekalinin/sitemap.js) library.

To learn more about sitemap.xml files, read [the protocol](http://www.sitemaps.org/).

## Installation

For now manually copy `package.json` and `sitemap.plugin.coffee` into `yoursite/node_modules/docpad-plugin-sitemap`.

To be published on npm soon.

## Dependencies

- [underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/). Comes with DocPad.
- [bal-util](https://github.com/balupton/bal-util/). Comes with DocPad.
- [sitemap.js](https://github.com/ekalinin/sitemap.js)

## Usage

For each document, you can specify those metadata :

``` coffee
changfreq: 'always' || 'hourly' || 'daily' || 'weekly' || 'monthly' || 'yearly' || 'never' # Change frequency, defaults to 'weekly'
priority: 0.5 # value between 0.0 and 1.0, defaults to 0.5
```

For the whole site you'll be able to specify thanks to the docpad.cson file :

``` coffee
hostname: 'http://example.com' # Base url of the website, should be changed
cachetime: 600000 # Defaults to 600000 ms = 600 seconds = 5 minutes
```

## Roadmap before considered usable

It's a work in progress for now. It has several problems, and will be considered usable when these issues are fixed :

- Figure out how to distinguish documents from other files (layouts, assets etc.) - [issue #1](https://github.com/DjebbZ/docpad-plugin-sitemap/issues/1)
- Figure out how to write file to disc properly - [issue #2](https://github.com/DjebbZ/docpad-plugin-sitemap/issues/2)
- Figure out how to use docpad.cson option - [issue #3](https://github.com/DjebbZ/docpad-plugin-sitemap/issues/3)
- Write tests and make sure the sitemap.xml file is valid
